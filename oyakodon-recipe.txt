Ingredients:
 - 1 chicken thigh or breast, cut into slanted, bite-size pieces
 - 1 egg, lightly beaten
 - 1/4 onion, thinly sliced
 - 1/2 green onion, thinly chopped (for garnish)
 - 1 cup steamed rice
 - 1/4 cup Dashi
 - 1/2 Tbsp (or less) sugar
 - 1/2 Tbsp Sake
 - 1 Tbsp soy sauce
 - 1/2 Tbsp Mirin
 - Shichimi tōgarashi (seven-color chili pepper), for optional garnish

Directions:
1. Add the Mirin and Sake to a small-diameter pan. Heat on medium high until
   mixture starts to boil and alcohol vaporizes.
2. Add the dashi, soy sauce, and sugar. Bring to a boil once again.
3. Add the onion slices in a layer and place the chicken pieces on top. Bring
   to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes to cook the chicken
   through. Skim the fat off the surface if preferred.
4. Beat an egg lightly (leaving some variation in texture) in a separate bowl.
   Slowly and evenly pour 2/3 of the egg mixture over the chicken and onion.
   Do not mix. Cover and cook over low heat for 1-2 minutes, then add the
   remaining 1/3 of the egg mixture and the green onions. Cover the skillet and
   cook for 10-30 more seconds.
5. Turn off the heat and let the oyakodon rest, covered, for 1 minute.
6. Slide the chicken and egg mixture over a bowl of rice, adding some sauce
   to add more flavor if desired. Garnish with the Shichimi tōgarashi for
   subtle spice. Dish goes well with mugicha (roasted barley tea) or oolong tea.
